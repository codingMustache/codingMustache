# DREADME

## Intro

This is a real simple way to get a Dynamic README for your github profile. I'm
using this as an easy way to set up modules to return sections of the profile.

## Using

You can add `npm start` within the directory and that will run the script.

### Sorting

The script is pulling files and using the node `.sort()`. Use
use official documentation on further sorting.

## Contributing

Use this and create little modules so you can update your readme dynamically.
Make a PR I would love to merge it. When making PRs merge your module into the
unused modules directory.
